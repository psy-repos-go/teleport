Teleport uses mutual TLS authentication with self-hosted databases. These
databases must be configured with Teleport's certificate authority to be
able to verify client certificates. They also need a certificate/key pair that
Teleport can verify.

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

Your Teleport Cloud user
must be allowed to impersonate the system role `Db` in order to be able to
generate the database certificate.

Include the following `allow` rule in in your Teleport Cloud user's role:

```yaml
allow:
  impersonate:
    users: ["Db"]
    roles: ["Db"]
```

</ScopedBlock>
